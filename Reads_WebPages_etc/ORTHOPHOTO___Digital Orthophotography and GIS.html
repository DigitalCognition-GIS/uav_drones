<H1>DIGITAL ORTHOPHOTOGRAPHY AND GIS</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>
<P> Orthophotography first came into use in the 1960's.  It was
expensive and time consuming to produce.  By the early 1970's,
technological improvements brought this data source into affordable
commercial applications and its use has continued to expand.  The
first orthophotography was produced by computer driven optical
methods and equipment.  Today, these pieces of equipment have been
replaced by the computer workstation and sophisticated computer
software algorithms.  The product of this technology is a digital
image that can stand alone on its own visual merits or be
integrated and employed within a geographic information system.  
Assessing the spatial accuracy and quality of the final product
should be of significant interest to the GIS manager who will use
this imagery in daily operations.   Experiences and examples
related in this paper are taken from the State of Vermont's
Orthophoto Mapping Program.  This program acquired its first
imagery in 1974 and provides printed copies to communities for
parcel mapping purposes.  Vermont was the first State in the Nation
to complete statewide orthophoto coverage.  Until this past year,
all imagery was produced by optical methods and distributed in
print format.  Transition has now been made to digital production
and the associated benefits and adjustments are just beginning to
be realized.  This paper will concentrate on the issues and
opportunities presented to the GIS community by this exciting data
source.</P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
 
<P>Orthophoto imagery was first produced over 30 years ago.  It
offers the advantages of a conventional map product, but unlike the
traditional map, the orthophoto is able to display actual ground
features, not cartographic representations of those features.  Up
until 5 or 6 years ago, the orthophoto was created using a
combination of optical and digital processing.  The digital
orthophotograph has became a commercial production reality due the
primarily to the increased availability of more powerful computers
at more affordable prices.  Regardless of the method of
construction, four basic operations or corrections must be applied
to the standard vertical aerial photograph to produce the
orthophoto.  The first correction is the standardization of scale
across the image.  The second correction involves removing the
relief displacement to position the terrain in its true location. 
The third operation entails the assignment of X &  Y coordinate
values to the image.  The final task involves the radiometric or
tonal adjustments to allow the image to blend with neighboring
images.  The key to understanding the orthophoto is first
understanding the geometric properties of conventional vertical
aerial photography, since this is the source of all orthophoto
imagery.</P>

<H3>Aerial Photo Acquisition</H3>
<P>Traditional aerial mapping photography is acquire in a vertical
format using very specialized cameras and lenses.  Mounted in gyro
stabilized mounts, these cameras are pointed straight down at the
surface of the earth and record their images in flight lines. 
Within the flight line, each successive photo overlaps the previous
image frame by between 60% and 80%. The overlap area between the
two successive frames allows for stereo (3-D) viewing of the area
in common and the subsequent collection of the digital elevation
model (DEM).  Where more than one flight line is required to cover
the geographic area of interest, additional flight lines are flown
with between 20% and 30% duplication (sidelap) between flight
lines.  This overlapping between flight lines does not allow stereo
viewing between flight lines or DEM collection.  Its sole purpose
is to assure that there are no gaps, often called "data holidays"
in the target area.</P>

<P>Each individual aerial photo is 9 inches square.  On the sides
of each frame (and on some cameras in the corners) are calibration
points called fiducial marks.  By drawing lines between opposing
fiducial marks the intersection of two lines will define the center
of the photograph.  This point is called the principal point.  If
the photograph is a true vertical photo, this point also represents
the point on the ground directly beneath the camera at the time of
exposure.  This point is called the nadir.  Figure 1. illustrates
the location of the fiducial marks, principal point and nadir for
a true vertical image.</P>

<IMG SRC="p1241.gif" ALT = "Aerial Photo Diagram & Nomenclature">

<H3>Scale Differences</H3>
<P>Scale of this imagery will vary across the photo in proportion
to the height of the camera above the ground.  Using the center of
the photo as a base reference point, terrain that is at a lower
elevation (further from the camera) will be represented at a
smaller scale and terrain at a higher elevation will be imaged at
a larger scale.  A review of Figure 2. illustrates this fact and
illustrates the simple geometry and similar triangles used to make
this calculation.  In the construction of the orthophoto all
fluctuations in scale are removed and the image is presented
constant scale.</P>

<IMG SRC="p1242.gif" ALT = "Illustrating Terrain's Impact on Scale
and Relief Displacement">
 
<H3>Relief Displacement</H3>

<P>Relief displacement is a distortion that affects the spatial
accuracy of the image.  Simply stated, points that are higher than
the nadir are displaced outward from the center of the photograph
and points that are lower in elevation are displace inward from
their true position.  Referring again to Figure 2. the geometric
displacement of both a hill and a pit in relation to the nadir are
illustrated.  The radial nature of this displacement is shown in
Figure 1.  where the flagpole is displaced outward from the nadir. 
In this latter example, the top of the flagpole is at a higher
elevation than the elevation at the nadir.  Relief displacement of
the terrain is removed during the orthophoto development, thus the
hills, and valleys will appear in their true location.  Relief
displacement of flagpoles, buildings, trees and other similar
features will remain on the image since the top and bottom of the
objects occupy the same X & Y coordinate on the ground.  This
artifact of relief displacement can cause some image distortions or
illusions, particularly along the joint between orthophoto sheets. 
While sometimes disturbing, most are not defects in the image
product.</P>

<H2>Digital Orthophoto Generation</H2>

<P>Creation of digital orthophotography starts with careful
planning and ultimately concludes with the final image product. 
The scale of the output product will determine the scale at which
the original aerial photography will be acquired.  For the Vermont
data, the final product scale is defined as 1:5,000.  For this
scale product, the original photography is acquired at a nominal
scale of 1:30,000. In preparation for an aerial flight, ground
control points must be identified or established and monument so
that they can be seen and recorded on the film.  X, Y & Z values
for these points are known.  These points form the basis for
control and coordinate assignment through a process of
aerotriangulation.  Several commercial firms are now enhancing the
ground control through the use of airborne GPS and supporting
ground station data collection.  This new addition to the control
process shows great promise.  This control process provides the
groundwork for completion of one of the 4 steps/corrections defined
earlier.</P>

<P>Once the photography has been acquired and the necessary
triangulation calculations have been completed, the photography is
ready for the digital elevation model collection.   This digital
elevation model will form the basis for the correction of scale
differences across the aerial imagery due to elevation changes.  It
will also be used to remove the relief displacement in the terrain. 
The elevation data is collected using an analytical stereo plotter
to view the photography in 3-D and collect a representative sample
of elevation points that will describe the relief of the area.  The
amount and type of information collected in the DEM will vary. 
This issue should be of considerable interest to the GIS manager
and is discussed later in this paper.</P> 

<P>With the DEM collection complete, the photography is ready to be
scanned and converted into a digital image.  In the ideal
situation, one aerial photograph will be used to create an entire
orthophoto.  The area should come from the central portion of the
original photography to minimize any lens distortion near the edges
of the photo.  Photographs are scanned at a very high resolution to
assure a high image quality in the final product.  It is during the
scanning process that defects of dirt and lint pieces can be added
to the digital orthophoto image detracting from the quality of the
final product.  In addition, any scratches in the original
photography that would normally be minimized during optical
enlargements, will be clearly be captured and preserved in the
scanning process making them clearly visible in the final
product.</P>

<P>The actual orthophoto creation is a computer based process that
marry's the rasterized aerial photograph with the DEM.  This
process allows for the software to reposition the pixels of the
scanned aerial photo to remove the effects of relief displacement
and terrain elevation differences.  With pixels properly positioned
and associated X & Y coordinate values assigned the orthophoto is
ready for viewing.  The resulting image is now at constant scale
across the entire image.  Only correction for tonal differences
between images remain to complete the process.</P>

<P>Radiometric corrections may be necessary to smooth tone or color
differences between orthoimages to improve the overall image
quality.  Pixel brightness values range between 0 and 255 and in
some cases a localize adjustments may be required.  If the
photography is flown just prior to leaves returning to the trees,
matching images between flight lines, recorded on different dates
may be challenging.  Differences in the time of day the photography
is acquired can also hinder the radiometric balancing between
digital images.</P>

<H2>Issues of Product Enhancement and Quality Control</H2>

<P>The recipient of new digital orthophoto imagery should plan to
conduct a thorough review of the delivered product.  Quality issues
fall into two broad categories.  The first is spatial accuracy and
the second is image quality.  Spatial accuracy refers to the
location of the pixel elements in reference to their true location
on the face of the earth.  Image quality considers defects and
tonal differences both within and across sheets.  Figure 3. is a
copy of the initial evaluation sheet used in Vermont to review
delivered digital ortho images</P>

<H3>Spatial Accuracy</H3>

<P> National Map Accuracy Standards leave a great deal to be
desired when it comes to the spatial accuracy assessment of the
completed orthophoto base map.  With respect to horizontal
accuracy, National Map Accuracy Standards state that "1. Horizontal
accuracy: For maps on publication scales larger than 1:20,000, not
more than 10% of the points tested shall be in error by more than
1/30 inch, measured on the publication scale; for maps on
publication scales of 1:20,000 or smaller, 1/50 inch.  These limits
of accuracy shall apply in all cases to positions of well defined
points only." (U.S. Bureau of the Budget, Issued June 10, 1941,
Revised April 26, 1943, Revised June 17, 1947)  With individual
orthophoto pixel sizes of less than half a meter, the image quality
may very well suggest a higher accuracy than the image can support. 
Many factors will affect the spatial accuracy.  One of those
factors is the DEM. Many producers of orthophotos only collect
their elevation data in a systematic grid.  Points collected in
this fashion are often called mass points.  While this may allow
the resultant product to meet minimum accuracy standards,
collecting additional points and lines will enhance the quality of
the final product and produce a DEM with more utility to the GIS
user.  Failure to at least collect points on hilltops, cliffs or
pits will introduce errors.  By collecting a DEM with a combination
of mass points, break lines and significant points, a more useful
product can be obtained.  The DEM should also be valued as a
separate product that will have significant utility within the GIS
environment in terrain and other map layer development.</P>  

<P>Perhaps the best way to sample the spatial accuracy is to use
the Global Positioning System or GPS.  Since National Map Accuracy
standards state that they only apply to clearly visible points it
is important to select points carefully.  If DEM points have been
taken along the major roads, the likelihood of an error on the
image is greatly reduced.  Finding points away from major road
intersections should be considered.  Other clearly visible points
such as swimming pool corners, sites in parks and other locations
will help assure the accuracy of the image.  By plotting the points
from the GPS collection on the digital image, it is then possible
to measure the difference between the image and the GPS point.  In
addition to checking the absolute difference between these
locations, the direction of any discrepancy should also be noted to
test for the possibility of a systematic error.</P>

<P>Since most digital orthophoto mapping projects cover large
areas, it may not be possible to take GPS readings for each digital
image.  As an alternative, the evaluator could consider using other
digital data within the GIS to look for errors.  In the Vermont
evaluation, the road network was available in an ARC coverage
format and was consistently drawn on top of the digital orthophoto
during the visual quality verification.  In this way it was
possible to look for suspicious areas that could later be checked
with GPS readings.  Figure 3. illustrates an example.</P>

<IMG SRC="p1243.gif" ALT="Discrepancy Between A Roads Coverage and
the Digital Ortho Image">

<P>Some spatial errors are very evident when the imagery is first
review.  Others are more subtle.  Figure 4. illustrates a gross
example of a spatial error between two sheets.</P>

<IMG SRC="p1244.gif" ALT="Large Spatial Error Between Digital
Images">
<P>Figure 4. also points out alignment issues between digital
images.  These errors are most evident along linear features.  In
subtle alignment cases, the error might not warrant rejection due
to National Map Accuracy criteria, however the visual quality of
the map may be compromised to a point that recreation of one or
both images may be warranted.<P>
<P>In Figure 5., the error is much more subtle and must be
carefully evaluated.</P>

<IMG SRC="p1245.gif" ALT="Small Spatial Error & Relief
Displacement">
<P>The image in Figure 5.  is a water tank.  and part of the tank
is cut off at the joint with the image to the south.  Careful
review finally revealed that part of the terrain was missing,
however, part of the top of the missing water tower was cut off by
relief displacement.  Since points that are higher than the Nadir
lean out, this type of distortion may not be a spatial error, but
rather an optical artifact of the original photography.  Similar
distortions will be found along sheet edges that image tall
buildings.  High bridges can also be a source of error or
distortion.  By moving the terrain under the bridge to remove
relief displacement the actual bridge may appear out of alignment
with the connecting highway.  In these instances, it is necessary
to adjust the image to move the bridge back into alignment with the
road to produce an optically pleasing image.</P> 

<H3>Image Quality</H3>

<P>Issues of image quality can be grouped into two categories.  The
first is naturally occurring anomalies and the second are human
induced errors.  Examples of natural quality reducing factors are
specular reflectance from waterbodies and deep shadows caused by
low sun angles.  Figure 6. illustrates several quality degrading
features.</P>

<IMG SRC="p1246.gif" ALT="Specular Reflection & Tonal Differences">

<P>The bright spot on the upper image in Figure 6. is caused by
specular reflectance from a body of water.  This natural occurring
phenomenon occurs when the angle of incidence of the sun light
striking the smooth water surface equals the angle of reflection up
to the camera.  The tonal differences between the images are fairly
minimal, but can be reduced.  The thick black line between the
images illustrates a lack of data and would be the result of
operator error.</P>

<P>Scratches can enter the image production at several stages.  The
first can occur during the aerial photo acquisition.  These types
of scratches come from the film transport mechanism as the roll of
film is moved in the camera.  These scratches run in straight lines
through the image in the direction of the flight line.  These
scratches will be picked up when the photo is scanned and will
appear on the digital image.  Figure 7. illustrates this type of
scratch.</P>
<IMG SRC="p1247.gif" ALT="A Film Transport Mechanism Scratch">

<P>Other scratches can be inflicted by improper handling of the
photography prior to scanning.  These scratches are often bolder
and more disruptive.  Figure 8. illustrates such a scratch.</P>
 
<IMG SRC="p1248.gif" ALT="A Scratch From Improper Film Handling">

<P>Dirt and lint can also be incorporated into the ortho image if
it is not carefully removed prior to scanning.  In general the dirt
specks will appear as dark spots on the image and can often be
confused with small waterbodies.  Figure 9. illustrates a digital
orthophoto with a large piece of dirt scanned into the image.</P>

<IMG SRC="p1249.gif" ALT="A dirt piece mistakenly scanned into the
image">

<P>Lint and hair pieces will usually appear as gray or white spots
or wavy lines.  These too, like the dirt spots are incorporated
into the digital image during the scanning process.  Figure 10.
illustrates an example.<P>

<IMG SRC="p12410.gif" ALT="Hair mistakenly scanned into the
image.">

<P>Shadows and the time of day can be a significant detractor to an
otherwise excellent image base.  This problem is exacerbated when
adjacent flight lines are flown at extreme ends of the flying
window.  In the worst case scenario, the western line is flown
early in the morning and the eastern image is flown in late
afternoon.  This situation should be avoided.  Figure 11.
illustrates the appearance of imagery flown at these extremes.</P>

<H3>Recommendations for the Review of Digital Orthophoto
Imagery</H3>

<P>Review of the digital imagery will involve spatial accuracy
sampling in the field with GPS.</P>
<PRE>
RECOMMENDATION 1.  Sample points away from roads and location where 
                   DEM points will have been taken.
</PRE>

<P>To properly review the digital imagery for errors and defects,
the reviewer will need to have copies of the original photography
at the computer screen.  A hand lens and stereoscope are also
useful during this review process.  It is important to consider the
scale of the contracted imagery during this review process.  The
basic review should be accomplished on the screen at the contracted
resolution scale.  Zooming in beyond that point to find defects is
not fair to the orthophoto producer.</P>

<PRE>
RECOMMENDATION 2.  Require that the DEM and the digital imagery be 
                   provided before the review process is started. 
                   It is often helpful to review the imagery with 
                   these point positioned on top of the imagery.

RECOMMENDATION 3.  Consider having the contractor deliver a point 
                   coverage for the centers of the original       
                   photography that can be positioned o top of the 
                   digital imagery.  This will allow the review to 
                   identify the photo from which the orthophoto was 
                   built.

RECOMMENDATION 4.  Where possible overlay the imagery with a linear 
                   coverage like a road or stream network from    
                   another map source to help look for spatial    
                   errors.

RECOMMENDATION 5.  Establish an accept/reject criteria before     
                   starting the review process.  Pieces of dirt and 
                   lint will occur.  Establishing ahead of time the 
                   maximum amount and size acceptable will        
                   facilitate the process.  This should be shared 
                   with the contractor.
</PRE>

<H3>Recommendations for the DEM data</H3>

<P>The DEM can be used in Esri,s TIN and GRID programs to develop
surface presentations.  If break lines are recorded for water
bodies, roads and streams, these lines can be used to create
coverages that will match exactly with the digital orthophoto.  In
Vermont, we have elected to receive the DEM in an ASCII file
format, as this information may be requested by many people, not
just ArcInfo users.  Each point contains 5 pieces of information
and comes on a single line.  In addition to the X, Y and Z values,
each point is assigned a code number for its type of feature that
could be used in the ARC GENERATE command and a code number that
represents the type of feature represented.  A sample line in the
DEM file would appear as follows:</P>

</PRE>

<P>Converting this ASCII file into an ARC point coverage is
particularly easy with the use of ERSI's ARCVIEW2 software.  Since
the file is a comma delimited ASCII file, it can be read and
converted into a table by ARCVIEW.  Prior to incorporating this
file, the user should first bring the file into an editor and place
a comma delimited line at the top of the file.  This line should
contain the field or item names that are desired in the future
point coverages point attribute table file.  An example is shown
below using the same sample data line from above.</P>

      ...
</PRE>

<P>  Once the file has been read into ARCVIEW2 using the xxx
option, this file can be converted to a view by using the "ADD
EVENT THEME" option found in the VIEW menu.  The final step for
ARCVIEW is to convert this event theme into a Shape file.  Both
pcARC and host ARC can convert this Shape file into a point
coverage.  At this point the points can be re-selected and
converted into various coverages or features for further use.</P>

<H2>SUMMARY</H2>

<P>Properly collected and delivered the digital orthophoto and its
associated DEM represent a significant addition to a Geographic
Information System.  In addition to enhancing the visual display of
information, this base map can be used directly to add or correct
the location of features for use within the GIS.  By avoiding the
use of cartographic representations of reality, exact building
locations or cover types can be correctly mapped directly from the
computer screen.  Figure 12 illustrates the use of the digital
orthophoto as a backdrop to a vector display of property ownership
lines and the community road network.</P>  

<IMG SRC="p12412.gif" ALT="Ownership & Roads Displayed with the
Orthophoto Image">

<P>Such a display can be used in 911 and other routing
requirements, community planning and a host of other applications. 
Equally important is the DEM which is initially used to correct the
original photo.  Its life extends beyond the orthophotograph and
can be used in topographic analysis and display.  In addition, new
software now allows the owner of the DEM to apply this information
to new photography to produce orthophoto imagery.  While this
operation is very compute intensive, localized update on the GIS
workstation are now possible with 3rd. party software packages.  
The key to all of these opportunities lies in the informed GIS
manager and a strong QA/QC process to assure image quality is
maintained.</P>
